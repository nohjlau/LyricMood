                I don't like your little games
                <br>Don't like your tilted stage
                <br>The role you made me play
                <br>	<div class="p402_premium">
                Of the fool, no, I don't like you
                <br>
                <br>I don't like your perfect crime<br/>
                How you laugh when you lie<br/>
                You said the gun was mine<br/>
                Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)<br/>
                <br/>
                But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br/>
                Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time<br/>
                I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined<br/>
                I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!<br/>
                <br/>
                Ooh, look what you made me do<br/>
                Look what you made me do<br/>
                Look what you just made me do<br/>
                Look what you just made me, ooh<br/>
                Look what you made me do<br/>

                Look what you just made me do<br/>
                <br/>
                I don't like your kingdom keys<br/>
                They once belonged to me<br/>
                You asked me for a place to sleep<br/>
                Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)<br/>
                <br/>
                The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama<br/>
                But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma<br/>
                And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure<br/>
                Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours<br/>
                <br/>
                But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time<br/>

                I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me<br/>
                I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams<br/>
